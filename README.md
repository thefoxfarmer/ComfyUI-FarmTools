# Farm Tools for ComfyUI

A handful of nodes I find useful.

## Installation
1. Open a terminal in the `custom_nodes` folder within your ComfyUI installation directory.
2. Run `git clone htts://github.com/thefoxfarmer/ComfyUI-FarmTools`
3. Restart the ComfyUI server and reload the UI.

## Nodes
- **Load File as String**: It's certainly not the only node of its kind,
  but when executed it _does_ correctly check whether the file has
  changed since the last execution, unlike some others.
